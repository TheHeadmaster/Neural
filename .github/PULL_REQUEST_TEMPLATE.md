Thank you for your contribution to the Neural repository. 
Before submitting this pull request, please make sure that:

- [ ] Your code builds clean without any errors or warnings
- [ ] You are using approved terminology
- [ ] You have added unit tests
- [ ] Your code is not messy or incoherent
- [ ] Your code has meaningful names in it

Fun tips:

- [ ] Remember, if you have to write a comment, your variable name probably isn't good enough (Unless it's like, math or Regex, we've all been there)
- [ ] 1. methods should be small. 2. Smaller than that.
- [ ] If you write comments in code I won't reject your PR but I'm definitely going to remove them later (No, not the Regex one)
- [ ] XML Documentation is fine, I use it, but don't slap XMLDoc on a parameterless constructor that says "Default constructor that instantiates the class" we know. I promise.

Also as a courtesy, please try to make the code formatted in the same or similar style. I'll end up changing it anyway if you dont ;)
